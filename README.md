This repo started out by trying to reproduce the computational methods in Weavers, Liepe, et al. "Systems Analysis of the Dynamic Inflammatory Response to Tissue Damage Reveals Spatiotemporal Properties of the Wound Attractant Gradient. Curr. Biol. 2016;26(15):1975â€“1989. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.06.012, and is thus heavily based on their methodology, but now implemented in open-source Python code, with some added functionality. For introductory tutorials, please refer to the repository that this is forked from: https://github.com/nickelnine37/DrosophilaWoundAnalysis

The requirements for this project are Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Skimage, tqdm, emcee and Jupyter. It has been tested with the following versions:

```
Python version:     3.8.17
Numpy version:      1.20.3
Matplotlib version: 3.3.2
Pandas version:     0.25.3
Skimage version:    0.16.2
Scipy version:      1.3.3
tqdm version:       4.64.0
Jupyter version:    4.4.0
emcee version:    3.1.4
```

but *should* work with python 3 and any other set of compatible package versions.

Start in the Notebooks folder!
