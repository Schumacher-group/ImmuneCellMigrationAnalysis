# Drosophila Wound Analysis

The repository holds all the code for my dissertation *A Cell-Tracking Tool for Analysing Cell Behaviour During Wound Repair*. 

The requirements for this project are Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Skimage, tqdm and Jupyter. It has been tested with the following versions:

```
Python version:     3.7.3
Numpy version:      1.16.4
Matplotlib version: 3.0.3
Pandas version:     0.24.2
Skimage version:    0.15.0
Scipy version:      1.2.1
tqdm version:       4.32.1
Jupyter version:    4.4.0
```

but *should* work with python 3 and any other set of compatible package versions. 

In addition, in order to input mp4 files, the module `ffmpeg-python` is needed. This can be installed by running 

```
pip install ffmpeg-python
```

Start in the Notebooks folder!
